# Sidecar

## 🧩 The Problem sidecar Solves
In distributed systems, certain capabilities—like logging, configuration, proxying, or security—are needed across many services. Embedding these into every service leads to:

Code duplication

Tight coupling between business logic and infrastructure concerns

Harder maintenance and testing

Difficulty in applying changes across the system

👉 If you're copying the same logic into multiple services or struggling to isolate operational concerns, Sidecar might be the solution.


## 👀 Example
- Imagine you want to unify environment variables for al services in your distributed system and you don't want to do it in every sevice one by one.

## 🔧 How Sidecar Solves It
The Sidecar Pattern involves pairing each service with a helper process—a “sidecar” container or module—that runs alongside it in the same host or pod (especially in Kubernetes).

**Key points:**
- The sidecar shares the lifecycle of the main service.
- It provides platform features without modifying the main app’s code.

**Benefits:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusability and standardization across services
- Simplifies service logic

## 🚫 When to Avoid Sidecar
- Non-containerized environments: Harder to implement effectively.

- Resource-constrained systems: Sidecars add overhead (CPU, memory).

- Simple monoliths: Might be overkill if you’re not decomposing services.
